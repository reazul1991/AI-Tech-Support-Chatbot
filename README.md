# AI Tech Support Chatbot

This is a custom GPT-4-powered AI chatbot built with **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **FAISS**, designed to answer questions about historical technical support tickets.

It allows users to ask detailed, follow-up questions about ticket topics, resolutions, SLAs, assigned agents, and more â€” just like a real customer support expert.

## Features

- Conversational Retrieval (QA over support ticket data)
- Memory-enabled follow-up questions
- Vectorized ticket data using OpenAI Embeddings + FAISS
- Powered by GPT-4 via LangChain's ChatOpenAI
- Secure API key management using `.env`
- Streamlit-based frontend (chat UI)

## Project Structure

```
AI-Tech-Support-Chatbot
ðŸ”¹ app.py
ðŸ”¹ .env                # (excluded from GitHub)
ðŸ”¹ .gitignore
ðŸ”¹ requirements.txt
ðŸ”¹ tech_support_qa.json
ðŸ”¹ ticket_support_db/  # (excluded from GitHub)
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reazul1991/AI-Tech-Support-Chatbot.git
cd AI-Tech-Support-Chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Set Up Your `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## How It Works

1. Vectorizes Q&A data from your support ticket dataset
2. Stores vectors using FAISS
3. User inputs a natural language query
4. Relevant ticket chunks are retrieved
5. GPT-4 generates a contextual answer
6. Chat history is preserved using LangChain Memory

---

## Run Locally

```bash
"streamlit run app.py" or "python -m streamlit run app.py"
```

Open the browser URL that appears (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Example Questions to Ask

- What happened with the ticket about product setup?
- Who handled the password reset ticket?
- Was the SLA met for email configuration?
- Which agent resolved issues related to the software install?
